## Why this Bot ? 
I just wantend to have create my own bot and be able to host it by myself.
The purpose of this bot is to make the usage of a Discord Server simpler, 
like give someone the oppurtunity to create channels and roles without making them admin or change their personal permission.


# Functions
The Bot is simple and does nothing complex or special. 
It has simple commands like 

/Create-role
/Create-catergory
...



## Note
This is a little side project and nothing to creazy or anything special.
I just wanted to share my project with the world
